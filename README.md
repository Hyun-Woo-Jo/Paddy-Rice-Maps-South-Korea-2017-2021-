# Paddy Rice Maps South Korea (2017~2021) 
Binary paddy rice classification from 2017 to 2021 generated by recurrent U-net deep-leaning model. As a result of prediction, it does NOT represent ground truth information, but can be used as a pseudo labeling.

There are available:
- a raster file with 10 m x 10 m resolution projected by GRS 80 - Korea Central Belt 2010 (EPSG: 5186).
### Covering the entire South Korea except Ulleung-gun at the East Sea where no paddy rice exists

### Model Used & Validataion
- Recurrent U-net trained with time series Sentinel-1 images and farm map labeling dataset produced by MAFRA (http://data.nsdi.go.kr/dataset/20210707ds00001).
- The trained Sentinel-1 images were composited in the following periods.

| No. | Start | End | Composite | Phenological stage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 10 May | 30 May | Minimum | Planting |
| 2 | 1 June | 20 June | Minimum | Planting |
| 3 | 21 June | 10 July | Mean | Tillering |
| 4 | 11 July | 30 July | Mean | Tillering |
| 5 | 1 Aug | 20 Aug | Maximum | Booting |
| 6 | 21 Aug | 10 Sep | Maximum | Booting |
| 7 | 11 Sep | 31 Sep | Mean | Ripening |
| 8 | 1 Oct | 20 Oct | Mean | Ripening |

- The model was trained with 7,762 patches and validated in 5,180 patches for each patch consists of 256 x 256 pixels.

- The validation `accuracy and Cohen's kappa value are 96.50%, 0.7857` each which were calculated from the 40% of the farm map.
